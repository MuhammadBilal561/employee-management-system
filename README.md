              Description

This C++ program is a console-based Employee Management System that allows admins and employees to manage work-related tasks efficiently.
It features a login and signup system with role-based access control, where admins can add, remove, and view employees and products,
sort products by price, and manage user accounts and notifications. Employees can view and sell products, track stock, view their personal
information, check salary, and read notifications. The program uses text files for storing and retrieving data persistently. 
Arrays are used to handle data for users, employees, and products. The system provides a simple interface for basic business
operations in a small organization.


             2.	Users of Application
   

1- Admin – Manages employees, products, user accounts, and notifications.                                

2- Employee – Views and sells products, checks personal info, salary, and notifications.

             3.	Weakness in the Project


  •	Command-Line Interface Only
               
The system uses a text-based interface, which is not user-friendly for non-technical users.          
  
  •	No Data Security
There is no authentication or user access control, making the system insecure.   
                  
  •	File-Based Storage     
   
Data is stored in plain text files, which is less efficient and harder to manage than using a database.




            4.	Future Planning

•	Learn and implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to structure programs more efficiently.   

•	Rebuild this project using classes and objects for better maintainability and scalability.    

•	Learn C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and data structures to solve more complex problems.            

•	Explore GUI libraries (like Qt or SFML) to create user-friendly interfaces for applications.                

•	Eventually, shift towards full software development, including database systems and web-based applications.
